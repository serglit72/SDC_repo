Extended Kalman Filter

The main goal of the project is to apply Extended Kalman Filter to fuse data from LIDAR and Radar sensors of a self driving car using C++.

I used the Udacity Starter Code.

Content of this repo

"scr" a directory with the project code:
"main.cpp" - reads in data, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE
"FusionEKF.cpp" - initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function
"kalman_filter.cpp"- defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
"tools.cpp" - is a function to calculate RMSE and the Jacobian matrix
"data" is a directory with two input and output files, 
"Docs" a directory with files formats description
