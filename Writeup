Finding Lane Lines on the Road


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
Reflect on your work in a written report
Reflection

1. Description:

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps.
1. I converted the image to grayscale, apply Gaussian smoothing, Canny algorithme and apply it for the image
2. I define the Hough transform parameters and run Hough on edge detected image 
3. I create a "color" binary image to combine with line image
4. Then I use video file and capture an every single frame in order to proceed it using p.1-p.3 as a function calls Process_image
5. Finally I concatinate two arrays in one and rewrite the video file



In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I  should modifie the draw_lines() function .

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:


2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when:
1.line is curve 
2.line is invisible or not so bright
3.multiple line intersection is difficult to recognize 


Another shortcoming could be ...

3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to ...

Another potential improvement could be to ...
